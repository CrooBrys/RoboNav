### Overview

The RoboNav Mobile App is developed as part of SE4450 Software Engineering Design Project by Team 7. It enables users to interact with OrionStar autonomous robots through the OrionStar SDK, supporting real-time status updates, navigation controls, and remote monitoring. This mobile interface offers a user-friendly platform for controlling robotic operations effectively.

### Features

- **Real-Time Navigation Controls**: Send commands to control robot movement to specific points or through preset routes.
- **Status Monitoring**: View real-time updates on robot status, location, and battery levels.
- **Robot Management**: Seamlessly connect and disconnect robots from the mobile device.
- **Error Alerts**: Receive notifications for any errors or issues in robot operation.

### Technologies Used

- **Android SDK**: For building a native Android application.
- **OrionStar SDK**: Integrates robot control and monitoring functionalities.
- **Java/Kotlin**: Primary programming languages for the Android app.
- **Firebase (Optional)**: Used for logging and analytics.
